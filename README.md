## Features
- **2D Map**: The game is rendered on a 2D grid map where each tile represents different elements (player, collectibles, walls, exits).

- **Collectibles**: The player must collect all items on the map before accessing the exit.
- **Game Events**: The game handles various events, such as player movement and window closure.

## Requirements
- **C Compiler**: Ensure you have `gcc` or any other C compiler installed.
- **MiniLibX**: The MLX library is required for rendering the game. Installation instructions can be found in the 42 resources or on the [official MLX GitHub page](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux).
- **Make**: Used for building the project.
